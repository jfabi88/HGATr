# HGATr
Current approaches to hyperspectral imaging classification have achieved important results, mostly depending on convolution-based
preprocessing that adds complexity to the approach. At the same time, these methods often do not directly integrate all the dataâ€™s
spatial, spectral, and volumetric dependencies at once. This article introduces Hyperspectral Geometric Algebra Transformer (H-
GATr), an approach that addresses these limitations by using a Geometric Algebra (GA) architecture to integrate hyperspectral
information into multivector representations, without additional trainable parameters. Thus, exploiting the intrinsic geometric
structure of the data is possible to obtain an efficient integration of all hyperspectral sample dependencies. Experiments carried out
on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that H-GATr is capable of achieving performance comparable to and even superior to
current models, offering a compact solution for remote sensing applications.
